# SemiMassive

SemiMassive is a behavioural operating system for organisations redesigning how humans interact with technology.  
We design systems users actually adopt.

This repository contains the public-facing architecture of the SemiMassive platform: Services (diagnosis), Solutions (interventions), and the Neural Matrix (capability routing). The website is the interface to that operating system — not a portfolio — and exists to make the methodology legible.

## Why this exists

Most products fail not because the technology is weak, but because adoption stalls before momentum forms. SemiMassive exists to close the gap between intention and real-world behaviour — helping teams design first trust, first success, and first proof.

We specialise in the emerging terrain where traditional UX/UI no longer fits: AI interaction, behavioural telemetry, and spatial interfaces.

## Architecture

The system is organised into three layers:

| Layer | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Services** | Diagnosis of the problem space |
| **Solutions** | Repeatable intervention patterns |
| **Neural Matrix** | Capability assembly and activation |

This structure makes the operating model legible: diagnose → intervene → route capability → deploy.

## What lives in this repository

- The SemiMassive public site (Next.js)
- The conceptual scaffolding for the operating system
- The visible expression of Services, Solutions, and the Neural Matrix
- Non-proprietary interface logic
- Accessibility and motion architecture
- Visual primitives (to be partially open-sourced later)

This repo does **not** contain client work, implementation detail, or the internal framework playbooks that drive interventions.

---

## Stewardship

The SemiMassive system is stewarded by  
**Nick Strine (Foundry Lead / Behavioural Systems)**  
and extended through a private engineering layer when solutions progress into deployment.

---

## Roadmap for public modules

Selected components of this repository will later be released as standalone open-source packages:

- **Neural Matrix UI scaffold** (capability graph pattern)
- **Line-based intervention diagrams**
- **Accessible overlay & motion primitives**
- Potentially: a distilled “first-win” instrumentation starter

The framework itself remains proprietary.

## License


No portion of this repository may be reproduced, copied, or reused without explicit permission.  
A separate license will be attached to any open-source modules when released.
