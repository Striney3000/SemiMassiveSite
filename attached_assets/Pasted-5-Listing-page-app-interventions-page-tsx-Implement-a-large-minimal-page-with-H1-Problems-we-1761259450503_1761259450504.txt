5) Listing page /app/interventions/page.tsx

Implement a large, minimal page with:

H1: “Problems we solved”

Brief subline (≤ 18 words): “Surgical interventions that change momentum inside complex products and teams.”

Fetch getAllWork() (keep util name if already used) and map to cards.

Card layout (large, tap-friendly):

Top line (muted): {meta.client} · {meta.year} (hide if missing)

Title: meta.title

3-line Problem → Intervention → Result block using the new frontmatter fields; if a field is missing, derive short snippets from summary/impact[0].

Pillar chips (meta.pillars) in a subdued row.

Whole card links to /interventions/{slug}. Add aria-label="Open solution: {title}".

Add generateMetadata() with canonical to /interventions and a meta description:
“SemiMassive solutions: targeted product interventions in AI, XR, and behaviour systems.”

Render a compact breadcrumb (Home → Solutions).

6) Detail route /app/interventions/[slug]/page.tsx

Ensure path/links are updated from /work → /interventions.

Above-the-fold section shows:

Title, summary

A compact three-column Problem / Intervention / Result row when present

Metric row from impact

Keep the MDX body structure unchanged (Snapshot, Context, Constraint → Breakthrough, etc.)

Export generateStaticParams using the new path.

generateMetadata():

Canonical: ${BASE_URL}/interventions/${slug}

OG/Twitter title/description from frontmatter

JSON-LD:

@type: CreativeWork (or “HowTo” if you prefer later), name, description, dateModified, image, url

BreadcrumbList: Home → Solutions → {Title}

7) Nav & internal links

Update any remaining references to /work:

Homepage featured cards → /interventions/{slug}

Footer links → Solutions → /interventions

Breadcrumb generators and header active-state logic

8) Redirects & sitemap sanity

Confirm next.config.js redirects() includes:

{ source: '/work', destination: '/interventions', permanent: true },
{ source: '/work/:slug*', destination: '/interventions/:slug*', permanent: true },
{ source: '/solutions', destination: '/interventions', permanent: true },
{ source: '/solutions/:slug*', destination: '/interventions/:slug*', permanent: true },


Ensure next-sitemap picks up /interventions pages. If your content loader path is unchanged, it should. Rebuild and confirm sitemap.xml lists the new URLs.

9) Copy tone tweaks

Homepage card section heading: change from “Featured work” → “Selected solutions”.

Any “case study” mentions → “solution” or “intervention”.

10) Tests update

Rename or add a smoke test: __tests__/solutions.test.tsx

import Solutions from '@/app/interventions/page';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
test('renders Solutions heading', () => {
  render(<Solutions />);
  expect(screen.getByRole('heading', { name: /Problems we solved/i })).toBeInTheDocument();
});


Update any route imports in existing tests from /work → /interventions.

11) Accessibility & focus

Ensure the Solutions nav item receives aria-current="page" when route starts with /interventions.

Each card link must be a single, obvious focusable element with visible focus ring (aqua tiered).

12) Done criteria

/interventions renders the listing with Problem→Intervention→Result on each card.

/interventions/{slug} renders detail pages with the compact triad row and MDX body.

All old /work and /solutions URLs 301 to /interventions.

Sitemap and canonical tags reference /interventions.

Tests pass; build succeeds.
