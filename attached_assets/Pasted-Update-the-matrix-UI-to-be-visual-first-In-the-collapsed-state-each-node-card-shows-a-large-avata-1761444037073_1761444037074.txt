Update the /matrix UI to be visual-first. In the collapsed state, each node card shows a large avatar glyph, codename, short title (one line), and an optional 2–3 pillar chips (or a single “pillars count”). All other content unfolds only when expanded. Maintain current geometric grid, reveal-on-scroll, calm pulses, and accessibility.

1) Card layout changes

components/MatrixNodeCard.tsx

Collapsed state:

Layout: vertical stack, big avatar on top (96–128px), then codename (H3), then one-line title (truncate with ellipsis), then either:

compact pillar row (max 2 chips + “+N”), or

a single subtle badge: “Behavioural · AI · Spatial · Research” (overflow becomes “+N”).

Remove skills, blurb, availability in collapsed view.

Footer row: “Open” button (icon + label) aligned right; entire card still clickable via role="button".

Expanded state (on click or Enter/Space):

Slide down detail section with:

Blurb (2 lines max)

Full pillar chips

Skills (top 6 chips)

Availability note (“Summoned as context requires” / “Contextual” / “Specialised”)

(Optional) subtle horizontal rule above detail for separation

Keep founder’s subtle inner glow.

Motion:

Expand/collapse height + opacity over ~180ms (disable under prefers-reduced-motion).

A11y:

Single interactive root: <button> wrapper with aria-expanded and aria-controls.

Title gets id and panel uses aria-labelledby.

Props: unchanged; refactor rendering only.

2) Larger avatar glyph

components/NodeGlyph.tsx

Add size prop: size?: 'sm'|'md'|'lg' with defaults (lg = 112px).

In MatrixNodeCard collapsed view, use size="lg"; in expanded header, keep the same glyph (no duplicate).

Ensure glyph stays crisp (SVG viewBox + preserveAspectRatio).

3) Grid & spacing updates

components/MatrixGrid.tsx

Increase row height and gap for breathing room: gap-6 md:gap-8.

Card min-height in collapsed state: ~260–300px to showcase the large avatar.

Responsive columns: grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4.

Maintain reveal-on-scroll and pulse effects; do not pulse the expanded panel content (only card shell).

4) Pillar chip compaction logic

components/PillarChips.tsx

Add compact?: boolean prop.

When compact is true, render up to 2 chips; if more, append “+N” quiet label.

In expanded view, render the full set (no truncation).

5) Text tightening (collapsed)

Codename = single line, medium weight.

Title = single line, muted (text-neutral-300), truncated.

Remove blurb entirely from collapsed.

Keep a consistent card height to avoid jumpy masonry.

6) Keyboard & pointer

Entire card is focusable; Enter/Space toggles.

Add visible focus ring (aqua) around the whole card (not just the button).

Pointer: default; only the “Open” affordance uses cursor-pointer to hint action on hover.

7) Analytics

Keep Matrix Node Toggle event; add state: 'collapsed'|'expanded'.

Optional: Matrix Card Hover (throttled) when user dwells > 400ms.

8) Tests

Update __tests__/matrix.test.tsx:

Collapsed card does not render blurb or full skills.

Avatar size is ≥96px (query by role/label then check bounding box via JSDOM style if available; otherwise class presence).

Expanding reveals blurb and full chips; aria-expanded toggles true.

9) Done criteria

Collapsed cards are highly visual (large avatar glyph), minimal text (codename + short title + compact pillars).

Expanded state reveals full detail smoothly; a11y intact; reduced-motion respected.

Grid remains calm; pulses limited to card shell; reveal-on-scroll unchanged.

Tests updated and pass.

Micro-copy recommendations (collapsed)

Codename first (e.g., Nova Sato)

Title second: “Interface Alchemist — UX/UI & Web”

Pillars compact: “Behavioural · AI · +1”

Visual suggestions

Let the large avatar subtly “breathe” with the existing pulse (very low amplitude).

Keep background warm-dark; use Aqua only for focus/outline and the tiny “Open ↗︎” icon.
