Services page with accessible accordions (all collapsed), FlowForge, and engagement model

Paste into Replit AI:

Create a Services page at app/services/page.tsx framed as “Problems we solve” with an accessible accordion (all panels collapsed by default), calm motion, and SEO. Keep copy concise, outcome-oriented, and aligned with our house style.

1) Route + metadata

Add app/services/page.tsx with generateMetadata():

title: Services — Problems we solve | SemiMassive

description: We solve adoption challenges through Behavioural Systems, AI Interaction, and Spatial/3D UX.

Canonical ${SITE}/services. OG/Twitter tags set.

JSON-LD:

Service schema (name: “SemiMassive Services”, areaServed: Global, serviceType: “Behavioural Systems, AI Interaction, Spatial/3D UX”).

Add a secondary HowTo JSON-LD for the Diagnostic (steps: Discover → Map → Prototype → Plan).

2) Components (new)

Create a minimal, a11y-correct accordion:

components/Accordion.tsx:

Controlled multi-panel, all collapsed initially.

Keyboard + ARIA per WAI pattern:

Each item has a <button> with aria-expanded, aria-controls

Panel has role="region" and aria-labelledby

Arrow/chevron rotates; focus ring uses aqua tiered states.

Props:

type Item = { id: string; title: string; summary?: string; content: React.ReactNode };
export function Accordion({ items, defaultOpenId }: { items: Item[]; defaultOpenId?: string }) { /* ... */ }


All closed by default (ignore defaultOpenId or leave undefined).

components/ServiceCard.tsx (optional wrapper): large padding, subtle border, big tap target; chevron at right.

3) Page layout

Use <Section> wrappers and <Prose> for readable blocks.

Heading structure:

H1: “We help teams solve adoption challenges in next-generation products.” (calm)

H2: “Problems we solve”

H2: “Our method: FlowForge”

H2: “How we work”

H2: “Get a 2-week diagnostic”

Respect prefers-reduced-motion (no expand animation when reduced).

4) Accordion items (content)

Build three items, all collapsed by default. Keep succinct; bullets not paragraphs.

A) Behavioural Systems (Adoption + Emotional Momentum)

Title: Users don’t reach first success — or don’t feel pulled forward after it.

Summary (one line under title): Adoption dies where comprehension breaks; momentum starts at the first win.

Content bullets:

Root causes: hesitation loops, early choice overload, feedback invisibility.

Interventions: first-win path, staged mastery, peripheral feedback that rewards clarity.

Outcome: earlier “aha” moments → higher activation → sustained usage.

B) AI Interaction

Title: AI features exist, but users don’t adopt or trust them.

Summary: Intelligence must be legible, guided, and accountable.

Content bullets:

Root causes: affordance opacity, trust gaps, pacing mismatch.

Interventions: prompt scaffolds, reversible actions, visible competence cues, guardrails.

Outcome: higher feature discovery, successful first attempts, reduced reversion to manual.

C) Spatial / 3D UX

Title: 3D or spatial environments impress, but don’t drive action.

Summary: Orientation is the interface; comprehension beats spectacle.

Content bullets:

Root causes: cognitive geography, unclear affordances, motion/comfort limits.

Interventions: diegetic wayfinding, curiosity-led choices, micro-goals every 90–120s.

Outcome: confident navigation, higher task completion, longer session completion.

5) FlowForge (method)

Short intro: FlowForge is our behavioural engine for adoption: engineer the first win, pace mastery, make feedback legible.

4 bullets:

Find the First Win — compress early choice; ship competence in ≤3 steps.

Paced Mastery — unlock complexity as confidence grows.

Peripheral Feedback — consistent, low-cog signals for guidance & trust.

Telemetry Loop — observe hesitation points; ship micro-nudges.

Optional mini diagram placeholder (div with rule + labels).

6) How we work (engagement model)

One intro line: Senior-led, embedded with your team. Fixed-scope diagnostic; focused pilot; elastic co-dev.

Three sub-blocks (H3 + 1–2 lines each):

Diagnostic (2 weeks) — Gap Map, Intervention Plan, experiment spec.

Pilot (1–2 sprints) — one leap shipped; success criteria defined.

Embedded Co-Dev — ship hard parts; transfer playbooks; uplift design ops.

Add a small line: Founder-led strategic operator; senior-only execution.

7) CTA

Section with H2: “Get a 2-week diagnostic”

Button: “Request an intro” (primary CTA, tracking hook track('CTA Click', { location: 'services' })).

8) Analytics hooks

On accordion toggle: track('Accordion Toggle', { section: 'services', item: <id>, expanded: true|false })

On CTA click: track('CTA Click', { location: 'services' })

9) Styles & motion

Accordion header: big touch target (min 44px), chevron rotates on open, focus ring = aqua.

Reduced motion: no height animation; just show/hide.

Default: animated height/opacity over var(--dur-soft) with var(--ease-out).

10) Accessibility details (must-haves)

Each header button has:

aria-expanded, aria-controls="panel-<id>"

id="accordion-header-<id>"

Each panel has:

role="region", id="panel-<id>", aria-labelledby="accordion-header-<id>"

Arrow keys: Up/Down move focus between headers; Home/End jump to first/last.

11) Tests

__tests__/services.test.tsx:

Renders H1 “We help teams solve adoption challenges…”

All three accordion headers present.

Clicking a header toggles aria-expanded and reveals content snippet.

12) Done criteria

/services renders with all panels collapsed initially.

a11y: headers/regions wired; keyboard navigation works; visible focus rings.

Calm transitions; reduced motion respected.

JSON-LD (Service + HowTo) present; metadata correct.

Analytics events firing; build & tests pass.
