Add sitewide links to Services + “See examples” from accordion items

Paste into Replit AI:

Wire /services from the homepage and footer, and add “See examples” links inside each Services accordion item pointing to relevant /interventions/* pages.

1) Header & Footer: link to Services

Header.tsx

Ensure the nav item labeled “Solutions” points to /interventions (already done).

Add a separate “Services” link pointing to /services (before or after Solutions). Large tap target, aria-current="page" when on /services.

Footer.tsx

In the footer nav, add links: Home → /, Services → /services, Solutions → /interventions, About → /about, Contact → mailto:….

2) Homepage: add Services entry point

app/page.tsx

Under (or near) the hero CTA, add a quiet secondary link:

Text: “See how we approach adoption”

Href: /services

Style: link-style (subtle underline, aqua hover/active states), large touch target.

Track click with:
track('Nav Click', { from: 'home', to: 'services' })

3) Services accordion: add “See examples” links

app/services/page.tsx (inside each accordion item’s expanded content)

Add a small inline “See examples” row at the end of the bullet list, using your CTA/link style but quiet:

Behavioural Systems item → link to your XDefiant onboarding slice:
/interventions/xdefiant-onboarding

AI Interaction item → (temporary) link to About/FlowForge anchor or leave a “Coming soon” placeholder:
For now, link to /about#flowforge if present, else /about

Spatial / 3D item → link to Atlas Obscura VR slice:
/interventions/atlas-obscura-vr

Example JSX (adjust to your components):

<div className="mt-4 flex gap-6 text-sm">
  <a href="/interventions/xdefiant-onboarding" className="underline hover:no-underline focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-[var(--aqua-700)]">
    See examples: XDefiant onboarding →
  </a>
</div>


For Spatial:

<div className="mt-4 flex gap-6 text-sm">
  <a href="/interventions/atlas-obscura-vr" className="underline hover:no-underline focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-[var(--aqua-700)]">
    See examples: Atlas Obscura VR →
  </a>
</div>


For AI Interaction (until a slice exists):

<div className="mt-4 flex gap-6 text-sm">
  <a href="/about#flowforge" className="underline hover:no-underline focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-[var(--aqua-700)]">
    See our method: FlowForge →
  </a>
</div>


Add analytics on each link click:

onClick={() => track('See Example Click', { from: 'services', item: 'behavioural' })}
// 'ai' / 'spatial' respectively

4) Accessibility & states

Ensure all added links have visible focus rings (aqua tier), meet 44×44 hit-target guidelines, and inherit reduced-motion settings (no fancy transitions).

5) Tests

tests/services.test.tsx: add assertions that:

The Services page renders “See examples” links for Behavioural and Spatial.

Each link has the correct href and is present in the DOM.

tests/home.test.tsx: assert the secondary link “See how we approach adoption” points to /services.

6) Done criteria

Header + footer include a clear path to /services.

Homepage includes a subtle link to /services.

Services accordion items show “See examples” links:

Behavioural → /interventions/xdefiant-onboarding

Spatial → /interventions/atlas-obscura-vr

AI → /about#flowforge (until an AI slice exists)

Analytics events fire on these links.

Tests pass; build is clean.
