Stage 11 — Build the About page (mission as headline, founder at end)

Paste into Replit AI:

Implement the About page at app/about/page.tsx with large, minimalist layout, calm motion cues, and proper SEO/schema. Use our existing tokens (Warm Dark Neutral + Aqua Electric), large typography, and Section/Prose/CTA components.
Tone: confident & calm. Structure: Hybrid (philosophy + capability + partner).

1) Route + metadata

Create/replace app/about/page.tsx with:

export const metadata or generateMetadata() returning:

title: About SemiMassive — Why we exist, what we believe

description: We help companies evolve from legacy UX to emergent interaction models — AI, XR, and behaviour systems.

Canonical: ${SITE}/about

Twitter/OG tags

Inject Organization + Person JSON-LD (reuse orgJsonLd() from lib/seo.ts; add a small inline personJsonLd() helper if none exists). Person should be Nick Strine with “Founder, Systems Design / Creative Direction”.

2) Layout

Use big, breathable sections via <Section> and readable content via <Prose>.

Heading hierarchy: H1 (mission), then H2 for each section, H3 inside “Principles”.

Add an optional subtle section reveal (using our motion helpers) once per section; respect prefers-reduced-motion.

Include a visible skip to content anchor target id="content".

3) Content blocks (copy placeholders)
Implement these sections in order:

(A) Hero / Mission (H1)

H1 (single line):
“We help companies evolve from legacy UX to emergent interaction models.”

One-sentence subline (≤ 150 chars):
“SemiMassive bridges relic UI patterns and new ways of interacting with AI, spatial interfaces, and 3D systems.”

Primary CTA: “Book a 15-min intro” (same component & tracking hook).

(B) Why we exist (Mission context)
Short paragraph block (≤ 120 words):
“The next era of product design isn’t click-only or screen-only. AI, spatial computing, and simulation have outgrown flat UX. Most organisations need help crossing that frontier — not by re-skinning interfaces, but by evolving how people interact with intelligence and complex systems. SemiMassive is a studio built for that transition.”

(C) What we believe (Philosophy)
Two short paragraphs (≤ 90 words each), then a 3-bullet list:

Para 1: “Design is not only functional; it’s felt. Products become intuitive when interaction creates momentum instead of friction.”

Para 2: “We treat flow and enjoyment as behavioural infrastructure — the basis for retention, confidence, and meaning.”

Bullets (actionable maxims):

“Engineer feel, not just frames.”

“Clarity beats choice early; mastery can wait.”

“Feedback must be peripheral, consistent, legible.”

(D) How we work (Operating model)
Single paragraph then 3 columns (cards or list) describing engagement modes:

Para: “We embed with internal teams to diagnose leverage points, prototype targeted interventions, and scale what works.”

Columns:

Strategic Advisory — opportunity mapping for AI/XR/behaviour.

Product & Org Uplift — design ops, onboarding/retention systems.

Embedded Co-Dev — ship hard parts inside your stack.

(E) Who we are (Studio network)
Two short paragraphs:

Para 1: “SemiMassive operates as a distributed expert network — UX architects, game designers, artists, and engineers from AAA, SaaS, and immersive.”

Para 2: “Senior-only execution. No theatre. No hand-offs that dilute outcomes.”

(F) Principles (Grid of 6)
Render as a 2×3 grid (large type, no chrome). Items:

Human before algorithm

Systems with soul

Design for flow

Clarity over cleverness

Small teams, large leverage

Emotion is a metric

(G) Founder block (end of page)
Visually modest block with a small avatar (optional) and concise bio.

Heading: “Led by Nick Strine”

2–3 sentences:
“Systems designer and creative director with 20 years in gaming, media, and product innovation. Led large-scale launches and first-of-type experiences across Ubisoft, Wargaming, Atlas Obscura, and Meta-backed XR projects. Focused on emergent interaction models where traditional UX breaks down.”

Optional links: LinkedIn (and email), open in new tab with rel="noopener noreferrer".

(H) Closing CTA

Copy: “Let’s explore how your product can evolve.”

Button: “Book a 15-min intro”

4) Components & styles

Add AboutPrinciples.tsx (grid), FounderCard.tsx (avatar + text), both minimal and responsive with large tap targets.

Ensure headings use font-heading, body font-body; generous line-length (60–72ch), line-height 1.6–1.75.

Keep accent usage sparse (links/CTA/focus rings only).

5) SEO / Schema

Use orgJsonLd() in app/about/page.tsx.

Add a small personJsonLd() in lib/seo.ts:

export const personJsonLd = (p:{ name:string; jobTitle?:string; url?:string; sameAs?:string[] }) => ({
  '@context':'https://schema.org',
  '@type':'Person',
  name:p.name,
  jobTitle:p.jobTitle,
  url:p.url,
  sameAs:p.sameAs
});


Render both JSON-LD blocks in the page (Organization + Person).

Internal links: from homepage footer and header “About” → /about.

6) A11y & motion

Respect prefers-reduced-motion: no reveals/animations in that mode.

Focus rings use tiered aqua; keyboard order logical.

Use semantic landmarks; ensure H1 only appears once.

7) Tests (simple)

Add __tests__/about.test.tsx:

import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import About from '@/app/about/page';
test('renders mission headline', () => {
  render(<About />);
  expect(screen.getByRole('heading', {
    name: /We help companies evolve from legacy UX to emergent interaction models/i
  })).toBeInTheDocument();
});


8) Done criteria

Page renders with: Mission H1 → Why → Beliefs → How we work → Studio network → Principles grid → Founder block (end) → CTA.

Canonical & OG/Twitter set; Organization + Person JSON-LD present.

Large, calm, minimal; motion assists orientation only.

Test passes; build is clean.
