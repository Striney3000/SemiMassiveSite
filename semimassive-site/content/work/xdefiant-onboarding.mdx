## Snapshot

Onboarded millions fast by clarifying goals, pacing challenge, and tightening feedback loops.

- **Problem**: early-session drop due to cognitive overload.
- **Constraint**: live-service launch, distributed teams, evolving content.
- **Result**: 20%+ uplift in onboarding session duration and cleaner first-hour funnels.

## Context

AAA live-service FPS with rapid content cadence and high first-hour abandonment risk.

## Constraint → Breakthrough

- Many first-time players misread ability and mode affordances.
- Telemetry showed hesitations at choice points and tutorial fatigue.
- **Breakthrough**: reduce branching early, front-load clarity, back-load mastery.

## System decision → UX expression

- "One path to first fun": collapse choices, stage unlocks, raise feedback salience.
- HUD and ability cues shifted to consistent, peripheral channels.
- Tutorial → guided scenario with immediate competence moments.

## Outcome

- 12M+ players at launch consumed onboarding with lower friction.
- 20%+ uplift in onboarding session duration.
- Team scaled 2 → 9, throughput +30% after Figma process changes.

## Transferable pattern

For SaaS/mobile: limit early choice to one recommended path, ship "first win" in ≤3 steps, make system feedback peripheral and consistent, defer configuration.

## If extended…

Progressive mastery track, adaptive hints from live telemetry, "returning user nudge" variants.
