## Snapshot

Turned long-form exploration into a complete, gamified journey most users actually finish.

- **Problem**: 45-minute interactive doc risks mid-way fatigue.
- **Constraint**: spatial UX, photogrammetry + 360° video, comfort limits.
- **Result**: 80% completion with clear diegetic guidance and choice pacing.

## Context

Branching, location-based VR narrative funded by Meta; heavy constraints on motion and comfort.

## Constraint → Breakthrough

- Cognitive load spikes at branch points and transitions.
- **Breakthrough**: use diegetic wayfinding + subtle progression cues to keep momentum without UI overlays.

## System decision → UX expression

- Spatial markers integrated into scene composition and audio.
- Choice presented as "curiosity pulls," not menus.
- Micro-goals every 90–120 seconds for progress salience.

## Outcome

- 80% of users reached full completion of a 45-minute experience.
- Clearer scene-to-scene continuity, reduced disorientation.

## Transferable pattern

For content and edtech: make progress visible in-line with the medium, present choices as narrative affordances, not settings. Reward curiosity with immediate payoff.

## If extended…

Dynamic route hints from gaze/time signals, lightweight collectibles that reinforce memory.
